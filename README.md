3. Map Ordinal Features
4. Feature Emgineering:
   1) One Hot Encode Categorical Features
   2) Check Correlations Between Features

## Data Analysis
1. Seperate Train, Test Datasets
2. Feature Selection using Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross Validations 
3. Trained Linear Regression, Lasso CV, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Regressions with a grid search for best parameters
4. Gradient Boosting Regressions has the best R-square (0.836).
5. Visualized model's fitness and residuals using matplotlib
